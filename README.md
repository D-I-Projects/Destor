## Description

*Only beta footage*

**Destor is Minecraft Server management program with a modern design. It is our first project and currently our only one.**

## Our plans in the future
We want to work on bigger projects as this one. We have got many ideas and are creative but we are currently not able to make them happen.

## Minecraft's EULA

With downloading our program you agree to Minecraft's EULA (https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula).
In the program itself we will ask you again if your accepting Minecraft's EULA, without accepting theres no way to launch the server.jar file because its a software provided by Minecraft.
